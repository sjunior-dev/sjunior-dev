# Sinesio Junior

I'm a Senior Engineering Leader with 15+ years of experience and a track record of growing, engaging, and leading high performing tech teams (15 to 30 people).

My colleagues would describe me as a positive leader with a proactive attitude when faced with adversity. My teams would describe me as somebody who can provide direction, purpose, and guidance.

I particularly enjoy providing clarity to chaotic situations, aiming for simplicity in processes, structures, and systems.
